1
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,670
You're up?

2
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,920
Wanna eat anything?

3
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm about to order some food.

4
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,550
Did you take me here last night?

5
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Yeah.

6
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,920
I tried to ask where your place was.

7
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,590
But you were really drunk.

8
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,590
Last night, did we...

9
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,110
Yeah.

10
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,480
But it's alright. I'm okay.

11
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,550
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,710
Why would you say that? I told you I'm okay.

13
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,840
How about you, Ming? Are you alright?

14
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,920
Yes, I am.

15
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,670
But I can't really remember anything about last night.

16
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Just remembered that...

17
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,920
someone sneezed when he reached orgasm.

18
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
Are you crazy?

19
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Who would sneeze when having orgasm?

20
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
The weather is nice.

21
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,400
One more time?

22
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,070
Ming.

23
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,030
Ming, no! I got no energy left.

24
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,030
Ming...

25
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,550
Shit!

26
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,510
I got a morning queue.

27
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,960
Gotta go now.

28
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,440
I'm sorry, Ming.

29
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,440
Find something from the fridge to eat.

30
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,110
I think I'll go home.

31
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,480
It's alright.

32
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,230
I put my key under the tree pot in front of the house.

33
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,230
When you're done, just put it back.

34
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:57,840
Joe.

35
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,070
Huh?

36
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,590
Will Tong be at the set?

37
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,590
Yeah.

38
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,150
Why?

39
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,190
Can I tag along?

40
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Sure.

41
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,920
I'm half an hour late.

42
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,190
Pao must scold me for sure.

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,880
Joe.

44
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,000
Huh?

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,630
You must not tell anyone about last night.

46
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,280
I know.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,840
Even if I told anyone, no one would believe me anyway.

48
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
I'm serious.

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
Alright. I won't tell anyone.

50
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,230
What happened, Joy?

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,360
What's wrong with Tong?

52
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,630
Er..

53
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,360
Tong isn't being bossy...

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
It's just that he's a bit sick.

55
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,630
Sick? What do you mean, Joy?

56
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,110
He was gliding along the set this morning.

57
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,760
That was the spirit of the actor.

58
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,710
- He might want to work quickly.
- Yim, what the heck happened?

59
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,550
Well, the drowning female character resuce scene,...

60
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,190
Tong doesn't wanna play.

61
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,030
So he wants you to play for him instead.

62
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,230
Me?

63
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,070
Me? How to? There are lines to be said.

64
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,150
They won't shoot your face.

65
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,030
And they will cut it to the scene where they talk at the infirmary.

66
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,710
I know we have stand-in.

67
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,480
But he's for the risky scenes.

68
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,590
The viewers must see Tong's face in this scene.

69
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Joy, you understand it, right? It...

70
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,630
Tong, Tong, do you understand me?

71
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,960
This is the first scene that he saves her life for the first time.

72
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,920
So, no matter what, I want your face to be seen.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,960
Alright.

74
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,670
I'll play it.

75
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,480
But if my condition gets worst,

76
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,550
I may have to rest

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,360
around one or two weeks.

78
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't mind that.

79
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,590
Alright, then.

80
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,030
Joe.

81
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,440
Yes?

82
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
Go change.

83
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,030
And play for Tong instead.

84
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,360
Calm down, I'll manage it for you.

85
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,840
Hurry up.

86
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Well, be calm.

87
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,630
Hey, go, go change.

88
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,880
Poy, go brief him.

89
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,880
Right away.

90
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,070
Everyone, listen.

91
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,630
The next scene we're gonna play,

92
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:54,840
Marasri will grab the female lead's head at the pool.

93
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,070
And she will push her into the pool.

94
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,920
The female lead can't swim...

95
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,150
but we got our male lead played by Joe.

96
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,280
He's going to jump into the pool and help her up.

97
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,840
Let's do it. Hurry up!

98
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,840
It's 10:30 a.m., and we still haven't filmed the swimming pool scene.

99
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:09,880
Hello.

100
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,670
Oh, hello. Hello, Lyla. Hi.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,590
Today I need you to work a bit.

102
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,190
You have to fall into the pool.

103
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,590
This morning, we had a staff check it out.

104
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,920
He went down the pool, it's not deep.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,030
I feel sorry for her.

106
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,550
It's her first movie and the male lead leave her to play by herself.

107
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,150
That's true.

108
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Look at her face.

109
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
I think she's really disappointed.

110
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I heard that she's a big fan of Tong too.

111
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,760
And look at how nervous she is.
I don't think it's gonna be fast.

112
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,710
Maybe Pao will tell her to be pushed into the pool all day.

113
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,880
I'm with you. I feel sorry for her.

114
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,400
Lyla, you wait here.

115
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,960
- Alright. And May, come with me to see the blocking.
- Alright.

116
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,670
- Hey, Joe.
- Yes.

117
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,150
Let's go.

118
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

119
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,110
Hi, my name is Joe.

120
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,110
I'll be playing the pool scene instead of Tong.

121
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,280
Oh, right.

122
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,800
And where has Tong gone?

123
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,280
Tong is a little unwell.

124
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,150
So he will be supporting you right in front of the monitor.

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,480
But it's really alright. He sent me here instead.

126
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
So you won't be so nervous.

127
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,960
Please help me. I can't really swim.

128
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,630
You got it, no worries.

129
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,350
I've been through all this before.

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,470
Jumping into pools, doing stunts.

131
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,470
And when I was little, I liked to play a mermaid with my friends.

132
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,840
Just imagine that you're about to swim

133
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,840
and save the prince's life?

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,720
Okay.

135
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,920
- Okay?
- Yes, of course.

136
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,000
Alright, silence. Ready?

137
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,470
Everyone, ready? We only got one shot.

138
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Alright. Camera.

139
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,190
And action!

140
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,640
How dare you messing with my Dang?

141
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,070
I...never...

142
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,310
I guess we can't do the talking.

143
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,680
Don't say that I'm cruel.

144
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,430
Get over here!

145
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
In case the water in the pool can cleanse your dirtiness.

146
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,430
Help!

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Walapa!

148
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,190
Cut!

149
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Great!

150
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:44,840
That was awesome.

151
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,470
Thank you.

152
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,470
No, thank you.

153
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,350
Hey, take care of the cast.

154
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I'll carry you.

155
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,230
Thank you.

156
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,230
That was really good.

157
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,430
- If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be able to do it.
- No, that's not it, you did great by yourself.

158
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,520
Are you cold? One sec. They'll bring you a towel.

159
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,350
Well, how was it?

160
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,350
Good. Let's go. Change.

161
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,640
I just knew that being a stand-in...aside from playing the risky scenes...

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
you gotta play him instead?

163
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,070
I guess.

164
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,880
I feel sorry for the girl.

165
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,390
It's her first movie.

166
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,390
But she was left to drown by the male lead.

167
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,760
- Tong.
- Huh?

168
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,350
Let's sit here.

169
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
About last night, I'm sorry.

170
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,880
It's alright.

171
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,150
If you're really okay, then that's good.

172
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:14,230
Here. The bakery from this cafe is really good.

173
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,560
I'm full.

174
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,230
Then, can I feed you?

175
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,230
Of course.

176
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,600
- The green one?
- Sure.

177
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
It's as good as before.

178
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,520
One more bite?

179
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,110
- Absolutely. Here.
- C'mon.

180
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,150
What is it? Why did you call me here?

181
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,310
Are you bisexual?

182
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,920
Huh?

183
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,110
Or do you always take care of every female lead like this?

184
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,030
Oh,

185
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,720
I like guys.

186
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,230
So when I'm around girls, I don't think of anything.

187
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
That's why you're close to the make-up artist like that?

188
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,230
Yim?

189
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,880
I was the one who asked him to work here.

190
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,390
We both went to the same school.

191
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,560
What's wrong with you, Ming? Are you mad at me?

192
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,760
Who's mad at you?

193
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,190
I was just asking.

194
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,190
Then, can I ask you, Ming?

195
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,640
Ming seems to be close to Tong.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Do you like him?

197
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,470
Don't you ever say that again.

198
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,310
Tong is my sister's boyfriend.

199
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
Oh?

200
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Then, I'm sorry.

201
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,110
Well, I didn't know that Tong got a girlfriend.

202
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,960
He said not to tell anyone.

203
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,680
He doesn't want other people to get involved.

204
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,070
Oh.

205
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,600
I get that. He's a superstar.

206
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,190
But I think your sister's awesome.

207
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:35,760
She's got the country's sweetheart as her own.

208
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,560
You don't think I know that?

209
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
What's wrong with you, Ming?

210
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,520
I'm sorry. I was just being happy for them.

211
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,880
And what do you want to have for dinner?

212
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,800
Hot pot? I'll make that for you.

213
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,800
It's alright.

214
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:57,070
I'll go eat at my place.

215
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,310
Thank you so much...

216
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,800
for being with me until the work's done for the day.

217
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,390
You're welcome.

218
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,070
Are you sure that you're not gonna go eat with me first?

219
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,030
Maybe next time.

220
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,030
I happened to have a plan with May.

221
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,430
Alright.

222
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,640
Go home safely.

223
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Thanks.

224
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,150
Oh, Ming.

225
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,470
Why didn't you tell me before coming home?

226
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,920
Have you eaten anything?

227
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm not very hungry.

228
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,520
Are you free tomorrow?

229
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,230
Auntie Mol wants to see you.

230
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I'll go shower now.

231
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,640
C'mon!

232
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,430
Remember, the main job for stuntmen is taking care of your body.

233
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,600
If this is unbearable,

234
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,030
the real work is much harder.

235
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,030
Come on!

236
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,960
What's wrong with Joe today? He's so uptight.

237
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,230
Why are you guys talking? Huh?

238
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,840
More push-ups! Now!

239
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
Yes!

240
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,560
I haven't seen you in so long, Linin. You look more beautiful, darling.

241
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,030
Thank you, Auntie.

242
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,600
You have good manners.

243
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,920
She's a shy one. She always go everywhere with her mother.

244
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,720
How about your son? How is he doing?

245
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
He's working hard.

246
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:51,190
Oh, say hello to Auntie Mol, darling.

247
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Can you remember Linin?

248
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,190
No.

249
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,960
Eh, where did they see each other?

250
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:05,069
At Tum's wedding in Kao Yai.

251
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:06,800
Yeah, that's right, that's right!

252
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,800
Can you remember Ming?

253
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,839
A little bit, Auntie.

254
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,560
You're so sweet. You can remember him.

255
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,880
Ming, go change, hurry up. We'll have a meal together.

256
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,880
Don't let her wait too long.

257
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,150
No need. You don't have to rush him.

258
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,720
Are we alright?

259
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,070
No!

260
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,190
Are we alright?

261
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,190
No!

262
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,150
We're training so hard. When can we find a girlfriend?

263
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,030
If you got one, you would be scolded like me all the time.

264
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,230
Because I got no time for her.

265
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,520
What are you talking?

266
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,960
Oh, it's nothing.

267
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,680
Hey, you got a girl?

268
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,310
Yes.

269
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,390
So...how did you start?

270
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,640
I sent her funny texts and said hello to her frequently.

271
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,600
You were like teenagers.

272
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,110
But...why are you asking, Joe?

273
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,110
I have a friend who's a writer, so he had me go ask around.

274
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Wait, who told you to stop?

275
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Continue!

276
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Push-ups!

277
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,470
All the way up and all the way down.

278
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,520
So you ran away from the political match to smoke out here?

279
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,190
But you seem like you're used to it already.

280
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,430
Well,

281
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,350
you're the third one this week,

282
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,230
whom my Mom made an appointment.

283
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,760
How about you? How many have you met this week?

284
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,720
You're the first one,

285
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,470
but this won't end easily.

286
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,760
That's normal.

287
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,000
Why is she so afraid of me having no husband?

288
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,960
These days,

289
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,390
if you got money, you could buy anything, right?

290
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,520
My main job is a stand-in but if you wanna get some, I'm a stand-by.

291
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,350
Was that your girlfriend?

292
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
No.

293
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:48,430
Don't think I don't know.

294
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:55,520
- C'mon, guys, dessert is here.
- Yes, Mom.

295
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
How about this?

296
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,520
You hurry and go see your girl.

297
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,760
And then I'll tell my Mom that you gotta go do something.

298
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,880
So we'll be free.

299
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Deal?

300
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,110
When you're at the brink of life and death,

301
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,390
focus is the most important thing.

302
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:32,390
Because if you lose it only for one second...

303
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Ming!

304
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,680
Guys, take a break, now.

305
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
Drink some water. Go!

306
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,190
What are you doing here?

307
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,030
Well, I'm kinda free so I came over to see you.

308
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,640
Are you busy?

309
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,640
Oh, not at all.

310
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,470
I just had the guys take a break...

311
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,270
so they could have some water.

312
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,430
And have you eaten? Are you hungry?

313
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,390
Is there a restroom here?

314
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,600
Yeah.

315
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,600
Then, take me there.

316
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Well, sorry, Ming. The restroom is kinda far away.

317
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,230
That's good,

318
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,030
so no one can hear us.

319
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Ming.

320
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,350
What are you doing?

321
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Hush.

322
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
Ming.

323
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I still gotta teach.

324
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Then stop me.

325
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,840
Our work is to not be afraid!

326
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,470
Hurry up!

327
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,960
No matter what, you gotta be able to take the pressure.

328
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,640
All the way up, all the way down. Now!

329
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,640
Patience!

330
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:35,760
You can't do it? Come on! Fast!

331
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,840
Don't whine. No matter how much it hurts,

332
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,840
You gotta persevere.

333
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,600
Ming.

334
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,840
Ming.

335
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,030
Ming, Ming, Ming, easy.

336
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,190
Ming, I can't hold it anymore.

337
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,190
Ming, Ming, Ming.

338
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,230
Ming, you like doing it from behind?

339
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,070
I see you only do this position.

340
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,190
And you don't like it?

341
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,230
Ming, that's enough. I'm tired.

342
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,230
Ming.

343
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Then stop me.

344
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,840
Joe.

345
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,960
Huh?

346
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
Can I borrow this?

347
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,640
Sure.

348
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,030
Wow,

349
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,070
why can't I look that good in that shirt?

350
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
What are you doing?

351
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,350
Breakfast.

352
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,600
How would you like your fried egg?

353
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,390
Sunny side up.

354
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Okay.

355
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
Do you want coffee?

356
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,150
Oh, that's alright. I'll make it. Leave it there.

357
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,350
It's alright.

358
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,430
2 sugars?

359
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
What are you staring at?

360
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,270
I'm just not used to it.

361
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,270
Normally, I live alone.

362
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,760
Ming, I don't have to work today.

363
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
Do you want me to give you a ride home?

364
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,150
It's alright. It's a mess in my family now.

365
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,840
Can I hide here for a few days?

366
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,350
Of course.

367
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,070
Or you can move in and stay with me for a long long time if you want to.

368
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,070
Just kidding.

369
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Here.

370
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,680
Are you alright?

371
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,070
C'mon, give me one more time.

372
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,560
Easy, there. Okay, that's very good. And gently down.

373
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,230
Are you tired? Ah, you're doing good.

374
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,190
Are you tired? How are you doing?

375
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,150
Here. Grab my hand. Easy.

376
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,110
- Alright, are you tired?
- Yes, I am.

377
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:36,960
Okay.

378
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,310
Oh, are you alright?

379
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,350
Easy, easy there. Okay.

380
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,960
How are you doing? Keep going.

381
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,960
Okay.

382
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,190
Why is Joe being so kind today?

383
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,150
That's true.

384
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,470
- Joe.
- Huh?

385
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,430
Is it true that there's a stunt from our team...

386
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,520
went to an audition to become an idol in Korea?

387
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,390
Who told you that, huh?

388
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:02,030
I heard people talking.

389
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,430
Or they were joking me?

390
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
No.

391
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,230
It is true.

392
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Sol! When did you come back?

393
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,230
Just now.

394
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,190
Hello. Hello. Hello.

395
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,190
No need to do that.

396
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,760
C'mon!

397
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,470
You, shithead Sol!

398
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,960
I thought you were gonna leave us for good.

399
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Asshole!

400
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,030
I just finished my tour.

401
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,840
So I wanted to come back to rest.

402
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,800
How are you, Sol? Did you get to to meet Lisa and Bambam?

403
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,000
I gotta rehearse a lot.
So much work to be done, so I didn't get to see anyone.

404
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,150
I'll be coming home late tonight. Don't wait up.

405
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,030
A celeb!

406
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,030
Hey, wait!

407
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,390
Let me take a selfie.

408
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,350
Actually, this is for my wife.

409
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,030
Smile!

410
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,030
My wife, she's the president of your fandom.

411
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,560
And tonight, we're gonna be partying till late.

412
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,800
Therefore, tomorrow, for you all...

413
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,270
No rehearsal, no coming into the office. I give you all one day off.

414
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,800
Whoa! That's amazing!

415
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,680
Bring it, bring it?

416
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,270
C'mon. Bottoms up!

417
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,470
Sol just came back, so you guys talk to him.

418
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,350
Ask him anything. I'm so excited now. He's celebrity.

419
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,110
Oh.

420
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Are you still mad at me?

421
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Huh?

422
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,230
Oh, no.

423
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,430
Why would I be mad at you? It's been a long time.

424
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
I forgot all about it.

425
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,350
But I still remember,

426
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,640
everything you did for me.

427
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,840
But I was still really young,

428
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,150
So I thought...

429
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
What?

430
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,800
You thought I went to you just to get you into my bed?

431
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,470
It's not your fault.

432
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,560
We all know that in this industry, there are lots who take advantages.

433
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,960
But now I know that you're not like that.

434
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,350
Sol,

435
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,230
I have never been mad at you.

436
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,350
Do you know that you're the pride of our team.

437
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,190
Here, let me tell you this.

438
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,230
Your music videos, I've seen them all.

439
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,110
I can dance to every song.

440
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,520
You wanna see it? You want me to dance to a few songs?

441
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Maybe two songs.

442
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,840
You should stop me.

443
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,920
You know I can't dance. What shall I do?

444
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
Right, Joe.

445
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,800
Huh?

446
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,070
The actual reason I returned isn't only because of work.

447
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:19,110
I miss you.

448
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:28,390
You two, what are you doing here?

449
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,000
The rest and I are waiting for you guys inside.

450
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,920
Don't ruin the party.
I'd like to ask you two back to the drunk group.

451
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:38,110
Let's party. Let's go!

452
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,350
- Drag me.
- Not drunk yet.

453
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,230
Whoops, I open the wrong side.

454
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:31,310
Joe, you're home now.

455
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,470
Where is the key?

456
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,150
The key...

457
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,000
is under the tree pot.

458
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Okay.

459
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,880
Who are you?

460
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,470
And who are you?

461
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:27,270
I'm Joe's close junior.

462
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,190
Today, we went to celebrate.

463
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,190
Joe was drunken by his boss.

464
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,150
Thanks.

465
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
I'll take it from here.

466
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,110
Joe.

467
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,150
Ming.

468
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
Ming.

469
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,960
Don't worry.

470
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
I'll take a really good care of him.

471
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Ming.

472
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
Why am I lying here?

473
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,720
You stank of alcohol. The floor suits you.

474
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:12,310
And who dropped me off last night?

475
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,470
I don't remember anything. Was it Wut?

476
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,310
A lot more handsome than that.

477
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:27,920
Oh, Sol?

478
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
Before, he used to be in my team.

479
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,030
But now, he's an idol in Korea.

480
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Well, it was kind of him to drop you off here.

481
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:44,150
If I hadn't been here last night,

482
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,150
I guess you would've used the condom.

483
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,800
What's wrong with you, Ming? Huh?

484
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Are you jealous?

485
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
Who's jealous?

486
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,920
If you're not jealous, then why would you be mad?

487
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,560
Talk nicely.

488
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,560
What's in you to make me jealous?

489
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,679
I'm sorry.

490
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:22,469
Don't be so full of yourself.

491
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
You're just a stand-in.

492
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:53,389
Sit-ups break my back; love breaks my heart.

493
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,430
What?

494
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,430
Good!

495
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,350
Keep doing exercise;

496
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:08,350
broken hearts won't break you.

497
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
Great.

498
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:34,190
The number you've dialed cannot be connected right now.

499
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,190
Please leave a message.

500
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,390
Why has Joe been having so many mood swings lately?

501
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,310
Oh, Ming.

502
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,600
Are you hungry?

503
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,920
I'll make something for you.

504
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,720
It's alright, sis. I've made it myself.

505
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,150
Hey, you've learned how to eat like this, mister?

506
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,600
Before, if it's not Michelin-starred, you wouldn't touch it.

507
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,310
You're exaggerating.

508
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
What's wrong?

509
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,270
Did you fight with Mom? Why are you here?

510
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
No.

511
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
I'm just bored.

512
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,800
Wanna take a trip?

513
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,560
I'll invite Tong, your beloved, along.

514
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,350
Sis.

515
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Today, I wanna be with you, just only the two of us.

516
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,350
Then...I'll grab some chocolate.

517
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,230
And then we'll lie here and watch cartoon, how does that sound?

518
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,270
We're not kids anymore.

519
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,270
Can we switch?

520
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,720
No.

521
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,800
It's dripping.

522
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,110
Yum.

523
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,110
It's still in my mouth.

524
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,430
Is it good?

525
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,390
Yeah.

526
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,390
How long haven't we both chilled like this?

527
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,840
Well, who told you to get a boyfriend?

528
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,230
I can't help it. I'm pretty.

529
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Seeing this reminds me of when we were kids.

530
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:17,030
If I hadn't been so stubborn and got
into the water alone like that,

531
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,720
you wouldn't have had to be so troubled.

532
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,150
Who said so?

533
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:24,150
If I didn't help you that day...

534
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,680
now...

535
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:29,720
I wouldn't have this stubborn baby brother right beside me.

536
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,190
Don't overthink.

537
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,720
In exchange of a pneumonia,

538
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,350
it's worth it.

539
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,000
Sis,

540
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,720
when I'm not around,

541
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,960
are you happy?

542
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,560
Very happy.

543
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:51,110
I don't have headaches.

544
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,470
But I also am very lonely.

545
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,270
Lonely? You got Tong.

546
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,800
It's not the same, is it?

547
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:03,310
For me, family is the most important thing.

548
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:10,030
Yes, it is.

549
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,190
Family is the most important thing.

550
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,520
And how about you,

551
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:18,270
Ming? Are you happy?

552
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,390
When I see you happy,

553
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:24,390
I'm happy.

554
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,960
No, that's not it.

555
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,520
You gotta find happiness

556
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,350
for yourself too, Ming.

557
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Sometimes, it's hard to do.

558
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,030
Even I can, I shouldn't.

559
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,960
If you got something on your mind,

560
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:48,470
you can come to me for advice at any time.

561
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:51,150
Understood?

562
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,960
I'm always on your side.

563
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
I know that.

564
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
But this one, it may take some time.

565
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,030
I promise you...

566
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
that I'll get through this.

567
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:38,030
So, we've trained for months, and this is all you got?

568
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,270
Get up

569
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,680
and do it again!

570
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,600
Hurry!

571
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,600
Joe, someone's here to see you.

572
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,350
Oh, Sol.

573
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,920
You're still as uptight as before.

574
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,680
If I wasn't strict...

575
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,390
would I be able to push you to Korea?

576
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,150
I was there for a long time...

577
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't know if I can still remember what you taught me.

578
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:01,470
I guess it's time for a brush-up.

579
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,030
Sol, I was kidding.

580
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,680
You are not a stuntman anymore.

581
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,230
What?

582
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,000
You're afraid of losing?

583
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,520
If something happens to you, Wut will kill me.

584
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,350
If you're not serious with this, I'll take you down.

585
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,640
Alright, Sol.

586
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Sol.

587
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,070
Sol.

588
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Hey, Sol!

589
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:44,070
Sol! Sol! Sol! Sol! Sol!

590
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,640
Wut will definitely kill me.

591
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,560
I'm really alright now.

592
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,720
What were you thinking?

593
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,560
I just wanted us to be like what we used to be.

594
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,230
Sol, you're a millions-viewer superstar now.

595
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,600
Why would you come back and get yourself hurt like this?

596
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:23,270
When I was there, people came to me,...

597
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,310
expecting something out of me...

598
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,030
I realized that...

599
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,030
only you were sincere to me.

600
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:48,470
I was foolish.

601
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,110
I was being paranoid.

602
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,230
And I ran away from you.

603
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
Can you give me one more chance?

604
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,760
What are you talking about? Huh?

605
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,760
No matter what, you will always be like my dear brother, you know.

606
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,560
But I don't want to be just a brother.

607
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,230
I don't want to be a friend.

608
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:21,030
I want us to be a couple.

609
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,720
I admit that I used to like you.

610
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,000
You were really cool.

611
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:40,350
But when time passed,

612
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:43,560
I started to realize...

613
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,920
what love really was.

614
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,760
It's like that someone...

615
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,760
makes you feel like you're home.

616
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,070
It's someone who can make you feel lonely,

617
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,680
although you can live alone by yourself.

618
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,150
You mean...

619
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,520
your boyfriend who's at your place?

620
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Yeah.

621
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Actually, he's not my boyfriend.

622
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:27,430
Even though, I want us to be a couple so badly.

623
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:50,390
I should've come back sooner...

624
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:34,640
Ming.

625
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
Oh, you're back?

626
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:41,600
How did you get in?

627
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:45,190
The key under the tree pot.

628
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:48,470
Oh.

629
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,880
What's that smell?

630
00:46:54,070 --> 00:46:58,070
I tried making curry rice with deep-fried pork.

631
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,800
I know it might not be as tasty as what you do.

632
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:06,880
I meant...the burning smell.

633
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,430
Curry!

634
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,270
It's burnt?!

635
00:47:16,230 --> 00:47:17,190
Is it hot? I'm sorry.

636
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,190
It's alright, it's alright.

637
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:20,840
Damn it.

638
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,840
Are you okay?

639
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:40,270
I've opened a window already.

640
00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:43,310
The smell will be gone soon.

641
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,560
I'm sorry.

642
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,150
It's alright.

643
00:47:57,270 --> 00:48:01,270
You know, my parents passed away when I was little.

644
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,840
So I grew up alone.

645
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,350
And my dream was...

646
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,350
seeing lights on when I came home.

647
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,110
And the lovely smell of the food.

648
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:21,110
And someone...to say, "You're home?".

649
00:48:23,270 --> 00:48:25,270
Thank you, Ming, for making my dream come true.

650
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,110
If you like it, make a copy of the key for me.

651
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,190
I'm too lazy to lift the tree pot.

652
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Wait, what do you mean?

653
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,880
Oh.

654
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,110
Weren't you the one inviting me in the other day?

655
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,070
Are you really moving in with me?

656
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:47,880
Huh, for real?

657
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,230
or real?

658
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,760
But I got two conditions.

659
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,390
What are those?

660
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,600
First, we won't mess with the other one's privacy.

661
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,430
Okay.

662
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:03,880
And the second one?

663
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,840
The second one...

664
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,560
you can't mess with other people.

665
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:11,390
Especially, that oppa of yours.

666
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,960
Can you do it?

667
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,350
Of course, I can accept any of your conditions.

668
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,350
All I want is that when I come home, I see you.

669
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
And...that night, were you jealous?

670
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
If you ask again, I'll change my mind.

671
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,070
Well, I wanna hear it.

672
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,470
Tell me, were you jealous?

673
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,070
Were you?

674
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:46,760
Mmm.

675
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,760
Huh? What was that? I couldn't hear you.

676
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:50,310
I've already said it.

677
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,000
- I didn't hear it. I wanna hear it.
- I said it.

678
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,800
- I wanna hear it again. Please. Were you jealous?
- No.

679
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:57,000
Please.

680
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Just eat it!

681
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:12,560
What?

682
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,960
What's wrong with you?

683
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,640
What are you doing?

684
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,430
No!

685
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,960
Ming!

686
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
Give it to me, I'll do it.

687
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,150
- Again!
- No!

688
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,270
Come on, hurry up!

689
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,920
Do it yourself!

690
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,190
- I want to do it again.
- No!

691
00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:43,390
If I can make a wish,

692
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:46,470
I wish that this night

693
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,680
will last forever.

694
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:54,310
It's a pity. It wasn't possible.

695
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,390
- Eat it yourself!
- No! I want it like earlier.

696
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,640
No more!

697
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
Isn't that too short?

698
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,640
No!
